The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains an image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as "favicon.ico" in the specified directory.

Please create or download a suitable favicon image and save it as /carbon-harvest/carbon-harvest/frontend/public/favicon.ico.
