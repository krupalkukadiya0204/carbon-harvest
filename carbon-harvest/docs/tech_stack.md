# CarbonHarvest Technology Stack

This document outlines the technology stack used in the CarbonHarvest project, detailing the choices made for each component and the rationale behind those decisions.

## Frontend

*   **React:**
    *   **Why:** React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and extensive ecosystem make it ideal for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows for efficient rendering and state management, contributing to a responsive and engaging user experience. The project already uses it.

## Backend

*   **Node.js:**
    *   **Why:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to use JavaScript on the server-side. It is event-driven and non-blocking, making it highly efficient for handling concurrent connections. This makes it suitable for real-time applications like a carbon credit trading platform. The project already uses it.
*   **Express.js:**
    *   **Why:** Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a great choice for creating RESTful APIs, which are essential for the platform's backend.
* **JWT**
    *   **Why:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. We are using it to secure our API and manage the authentication and authorization of users.

## Database

*   **PostgreSQL:**
    *   **Why:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system. It is chosen for CarbonHarvest due to its:
        *   **Data Integrity:** PostgreSQL enforces data integrity through constraints and transactions, ensuring that data is accurate and consistent. This is crucial for a financial platform.
        *   **Scalability:** PostgreSQL can handle large datasets and concurrent connections, making it suitable for a growing platform.
        *   **Advanced Features:** It supports advanced features like foreign keys, triggers, and stored procedures.
        *   **Geospatial Data:** It has the PostGIS extension, which allows for handling geospatial data. This could be useful in the future for mapping carbon offset projects.
        *   **Open Source:** It's open source, which means it's cost-effective and has a large community.
        *   **Reliability:** It is known for its reliability and stability.
        *   **Community:** It has a large community with a great support and many resources.

## Cloud Infrastructure
*   **AWS (Amazon Web Services):**
    *   **Why:** We have chosen AWS as our cloud infrastructure provider due to its comprehensive suite of services, scalability, and proven reliability. It's a market leader in cloud computing, offering a wide range of tools that we need. AWS provides excellent security features, robust infrastructure, and strong support for our chosen technologies (Node.js and PostgreSQL). It also allows us to scale our resources up or down based on demand, optimizing costs. The most important services that we will use are:
        *   **EC2:** To deploy our backend server.
        *   **RDS:** For our Postgres database.
        * **S3:** To store files and assets.
        * **Other service:** We can use other service in the future such as Route 53 , Load Balancer, and CloudWatch.
* **Docker**
    * **Why:** Docker allows us to build, package, and deploy applications in a lightweight, portable containers. This ensures that our applications will run consistently across different environments. Also it simplify the process of deploying to our cloud provider.

## Third-Party Services

*   **Stripe:**
    *   **Why:** Stripe is a widely-used payment processing platform. We will use it for handling secure transactions on the carbon credit marketplace, allowing farmers and buyers to make and receive payments seamlessly.
*   **Mailgun:**
    *   **Why:** Mailgun is an email delivery service that provides reliable and scalable email sending infrastructure. We will use it to send emails for user registration, password reset, notifications, and other communication.
* **Twilio**
    * **Why:** We will use Twilio to handle SMS for notifications, security and user registration.

This stack is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for the CarbonHarvest platform. Each technology is chosen to fulfill a specific need and ensure the platform's long-term success.
