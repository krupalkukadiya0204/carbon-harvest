# Verification Framework for Carbon Credits

This document outlines the verification framework for carbon credits generated through the CarbonHarvest platform, ensuring transparency, accuracy, and adherence to best practices.

## Eligibility Criteria

This section details the criteria that projects must meet to be eligible for generating carbon credits within our framework.

*   **Project Type:** List the types of projects that are eligible (e.g., afforestation, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture).
*   **Additionality:** Describe how projects must demonstrate that their emission reductions are additional, i.e., they would not have occurred in the absence of the project.
*   **Permanence:** Explain how projects must ensure that the emission reductions are permanent or have mechanisms in place to address potential reversals.
*   **Leakage:** Describe how projects must minimize and account for any potential increases in emissions outside the project boundary (leakage).
*   **Baseline:** Define the requirements for establishing a credible baseline scenario against which emission reductions will be measured.
*   **Double Counting:** Explain how we prevent double-counting.
*   **Credibility:** Projects must adhere to recognized carbon accounting standards and methodologies.

## MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) Process

This section describes the process for monitoring, reporting, and verifying emission reductions.

### Monitoring

*   **Monitoring Plan:** Describe the requirements for a monitoring plan, including:
    *   Data to be collected.
    *   Frequency of data collection.
    *   Methods for data collection.
    *   Responsibilities for data collection.
*   **Data Management:** Outline how data will be stored, managed, and secured.
* **Calculation Methodologies:** Describe the methodologies for calculating emission reductions.

### Reporting

*   **Reporting Requirements:** Detail the reporting requirements, including:
    *   Reporting frequency.
    *   Reporting format.
    *   Information to be included in reports.
*   **Transparency:** Explain how reporting will be made transparent and accessible.

### Verification

*   **Verification Process:** Describe the verification process, including:
    *   Verification frequency.
    *   Verification standards to be used.
    *   Roles and responsibilities in the verification process.
    *   Documentation Requirements.
*   **Verification Report:** Explain the format and content of the verification report.
*  **Verification Status tracking:** explain how the system will manage the verification status of each project.

## Third-Party Verification

This section outlines the requirements and procedures for third-party verification.

*   **Verification Bodies:** Describe the criteria for selecting accredited verification bodies.
*   **Independence:** Explain how independence of verification bodies will be ensured.
*   **Verification Scope:** Define the scope of third-party verification, including the types of data and documentation that will be reviewed.
*   **Verification Outcome:** Detail the process for issuing verification statements and handling discrepancies or issues identified during verification.
* **Certification and Accreditation:** Describe the requirements for certification and accreditation of verification bodies.
* **Dispute Resolution:** Outline the process for addressing disputes related to verification outcomes.
* **Impartiality:** Ensure that third-party verifiers have no conflicts of interest with the projects they verify.

## Data Integrity Measures

This section describes how CarbonHarvest will ensure the integrity of the data used to calculate carbon credits.

*   **Data Collection Protocols:** Standardized protocols for data collection, including training for data collectors and the use of calibrated instruments.
*   **Data Validation:** Procedures for checking the accuracy and completeness of data, such as cross-referencing data from different sources.
*   **Data Security:** Measures to protect data from loss, theft, or tampering, including data encryption and secure storage.
*   **Audit Trails:** Systems to track changes made to data and who made them.
* **Regular Review:** the data and monitoring processes must be regulary reviewed to improve it.

## Dispute Resolution

This section outlines the process for resolving disputes related to the eligibility of carbon credits or the verification process.

*   **Submission of Disputes:** A formal procedure for submitting disputes, including who can submit a dispute and what information must be provided.
*   **Investigation:** The process CarbonHarvest will use to investigate disputes.
*   **Decision-Making:** Who will make decisions about disputes, and what criteria will they use?
*   **Appeals:** The process for appealing decisions made in dispute resolution.
* **Timeline:** Set out the timeline for resolving each step.

## Technology for Verification

This section describes the technology that will be used to support the verification process.

*   **Data Management Systems:** Software that will be used to manage the large amounts of data associated with carbon credits.
*   **Blockchain:** Using blockchain for secure and transparent tracking of carbon credits.
*   **Remote Sensing:** Using satellite data to verify carbon sequestration and land use changes.
* **AI/ML:** Applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning for analyzing data.

## Verification Frequency
* **Regular:** Every year
* **Event-Driven:** Verification in case of major changes in projects.

## Continuous Improvement

This framework will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect best practices and lessons learned in the carbon markets and technological advancements.
