# CarbonHarvest Regulatory Roadmap (India)

This document outlines the initial regulatory and legal considerations for CarbonHarvest, a carbon credit trading platform operating in India.

## Key Regulations

*   **The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986:** This is the overarching environmental legislation in India, providing the framework for regulating activities impacting the environment.
*   **Energy Conservation Act, 2001:** This act promotes energy efficiency and conservation, relevant for carbon credit projects aimed at reducing energy consumption.
*   **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):** This plan outlines India's strategy for addressing climate change, including missions related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable habitats.
*   **Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme:** A market-based mechanism under the Energy Conservation Act that mandates energy efficiency improvements for designated industries.
*   **State-Level Environmental Regulations:** Each state may have its own regulations and policies related to environmental protection, pollution control, and resource management.
*   **Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE):**  An agency responsible for promoting energy efficiency and formulating related standards and labels.
*   **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):** Responsible for setting standards for emissions and discharges and monitoring environmental compliance.
*   **UNFCCC Guidelines:** The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provides international guidance on carbon credit markets and mechanisms, particularly through Article 6.

## Compliance Requirements

*   **Project Registration:** All carbon credit projects must be registered with the relevant authorities (to be determined based on the specific regulation).
*   **Baseline Establishment:** Clearly defining the baseline emissions scenario against which emission reductions will be measured.
*   **Additionality Demonstration:** Proving that the emission reductions achieved are additional to what would have occurred under a "business-as-usual" scenario.
*   **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):** Depending on the scale and nature of the project, an EIA might be required to assess its potential environmental impacts.
*   **Permits and Approvals:** Obtaining necessary permits and approvals from relevant environmental and energy authorities.
*   **Reporting and Disclosure:** Transparently reporting project activities, emission reductions, and environmental impacts.

## MRV Standards (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification)

*   **Monitoring Plans:** Developing detailed plans outlining how project performance and emission reductions will be monitored.
*   **Data Collection:** Implementing robust systems for collecting relevant data, including energy consumption, emission levels, and other project parameters.
*   **Reporting Protocols:** Adhering to standardized reporting formats and timelines for submitting project data to the verification bodies.
*   **Verification Process:** Undergoing independent verification by accredited third-party entities to ensure the accuracy and credibility of reported emission reductions.
*   **Data Management:** Establishing secure and transparent systems for data storage and management.
* **Transparency and Traceability:** The system need to allow to track all the changes and all the process in an immutable way.

## Legal Considerations

*   **Contractual Agreements:** Developing legally sound contracts for carbon credit transactions between project developers, buyers, and intermediaries.
*   **Liability Framework:** Defining the liability of each stakeholder in case of project underperformance or non-compliance.
*   **Ownership of Carbon Credits:** Clearly establishing the ownership rights of generated carbon credits.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Defining mechanisms for resolving disputes related to carbon credit transactions or project performance.
* **Data protection:** Ensuring all user data are protected and handled with care.

## Government Engagement Strategy

*   **Identifying Key Stakeholders:** Mapping out relevant government agencies and officials involved in environmental and energy policy.
*   **Engagement Plan:** Developing a strategy for engaging with government agencies, including regular communication and meetings.
*   **Policy Input:** Providing input on potential policy reforms and regulations related to carbon trading.
*   **Partnerships:** Exploring opportunities for public-private partnerships to support carbon credit projects and promote market development.
* **Transparency and Traceability:** Making sure that all the actions and the information is transperant and traceable.
